	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect,
	process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that
	be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative
	consequences. Organizations transmit sensitive data across networks and to other devices in the course of doing business, and cyber security describes the
	discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to process or store it.<br> As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, 
	companies and organizations, especially those that are tasked with safeguarding information relating to national security, health, or financial records, 
	need to take steps to protect their sensitive business and personnel information. As early as March 2013, the nationâ€™s top intelligence officials cautioned
	that cyber attacks and digital spying are the top threat to national security, eclipsing even terrorism.</td>

	methodology to employ use cases to drive software design. It also uses other design products similar to those used by object-modeling technique.<br>
	It was first documented in the 1992 book Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach, ISBN 0-201-54435-0 Search this book on .<br>
	The tool Objectory was created by the team at Objectory AB to implement the OOSE methodology. After success in the marketplace, other tool vendors also 
	supported OOSE.<br>After Rational Software bought Objectory AB, the OOSE notation, methodology, and tools became superseded.<br>As one of the primary
	sources of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), concepts and notation from OOSE have been incorporated into UML.<br>The methodology part of OOSE has since
	evolved into the Rational Unified Process (RUP).<br>The OOSE tools have been replaced by tools supporting UML and RUP.<br>OOSE has been largely replaced
	by the UML notation and by the RUP methodology.</td>

	expected. It can also be static in nature; reviewing code and its associated documentation.<br>Software testing is often used to answer the question:

	<td rowspan="8"><h3><b>ABOUT:-</b></h3><br>The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs
	primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) until being superseded by the cross-platform
	.NET project. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written
	in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware 
	environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management,
	and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.<br>
	FCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications.
	Programmers produce software by combining their source code with the .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be used by most new 
	applications created for the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio.<br>
	.NET Framework began as proprietary software, although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately, even before its first release.<br></td>
